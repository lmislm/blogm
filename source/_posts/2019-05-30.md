LeetCode 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
      _6_
    /    \\
    2      8
   /  \\    / \\
  0   4  7   9
 / \\
3   5

For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### 分析
注意这颗是中序遍历的二叉树，左子树节点值小于根节点值小于右子树节点值。

### 题解
```javascript
function lowestCommonAncestor (root, p, q) {
  while(true){
    let value =  root.val
    if(p.val >= value && value >= q.val || p.val <= value && value <= q.val){
      return root
    } else if(p.val > value && q.val > value){
      root =  root.right
    } else {
      root =  root.left
    }
  }
}
```
